										using NodeJS app, AWS EC2, GitHub and Dockerization</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project includes a standard Todo NodeJS application, which is performed via Amazon EC2 server; the application is containerized by using docker at first; then the application is built with docker build; eventually, the application is executed using docker run; and finally, we have configured Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous delivery. In conclusion, I have utilized GitHub Webhooks as an automation method for the Jenkins tool. Whenever a change or modification is made in a Git repository, the pipeline will be immediately activated.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Two way CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and CodePipeline<br />
										using Django app, AWS EC2, CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, GitHub, Docker and jenkins</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The local car wash vendor "LAVE-DE AUTO LUXE" was the inspiration for this project's design. It is a Django-based application that is executed via the use of a two-way CICD pipeline architecture (using CodePipeline and Jenkins). In this instance, we have made use of Amazon EC2 as a computational resource, in addition to a container for operating system-independent applications, and the automated tool jenkins. In addition to this, we have designed an AWS solution for it by using Codepipeline and ElasticBeanstalk for the purpose of delivering the same solution.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Integrated pipeline<br />
										using Amazon EC2, GitHub, Jenkins and Ansible</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I utilized four EC2 servers: one for development, one for the web, one for Jenkins, and one for Ansible. I have integrated Jenkins server with GitHub so that it would automatically trigger when a repository update is occurred, this is carried out via GitHub webhook. Additionally, I've been able to login to Jenkins, Ansible, the web server, and other systems without a password using SSH connectivity. Moreover , I have established a Jenkins pipeline in which I uploaded a simple Catering HTML application from GitHub to Jenkins, after which Jenkins' output was replicated to an Ansible server. Then the playbook is triggered at the ansible server, where the output is then sent to the final web server.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Implementation of transfering<br />
										daily project releases to all nodes using Jenkins pipeline</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I have incorporated five EC2 servers for this project; one server was used for Jenkins and Maven, one server was used for ansible, and three server nodes were used for tomcat. I have linked the Jenkins server with GitHub so that it will automatically trigger through GitHub webhook whenever the project backup repository receives an update. In addition, I have successfully logged in to Jenkins, Ansible, and other tomcat servers via SSH access without needing a password. In addition, I have set up a Jenkins pipeline, and as part of that process, I have changed the Git repository to include one maven project. This will cause the pipeline to be initialized. In conclusion, as shown in the figure, a number of jobs are going to be automated, and output is going to be delivered to a number of nodes. These projects was built so that a daily deployment release copy may be kept and sent to all nodes in order to facilitate monitoring of ongoing deployments.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">CI/CD jenkins Maven pipeline<br />
										using GitHub, Jenkins, ansible and Docker </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project contains a Java Maven application, which is carried out on an Amazon EC2 server. The application was compiled on a Jenkins server to provide a continuous build, and after that, it was connected with ansible to ensure a continuous delivery. Ansible server is responsible for the execution of playbooks, and these playbooks are configured as YML file type. Further, Docker is used to copy applications and containerize them. Additionally, the image is posted to Docker-Hub in addition to being deployed to a Docker server. In this example, we utilized the Maven Integration Plugin for the Pipeline Type of Project.
										In the last step, the image is obtained from Docker-Hub and imported into Docker.</p>
